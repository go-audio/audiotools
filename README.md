Generic tools to deal with audio content. The goal of this repo is to provide a
list of abstraction for common cases while developers can always reach directly
to the specific audio packages.

An example of such tools would be to guess the format of an audio file, as shown [here](https://github.com/go-audio/audiotools/blob/master/file_test.go#L10)
